Well, I am as crazy as anyone could be about wine, wine history and what wine means to all of us. As I enter the twilight of my life, I am beginning more and more to believe that I was born to tell the story of wine. Every time I visit a vineyard, I feel different, as if the grapes on the vines are talking to me. I had visited Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild on many occasions, but in the spring of 2011, the visit was simply magical. As I sipped the barrel sample of the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, I recounted the many times before when I was slightly underwhelmed. This of course is ironic since this is of the grandest wine properties in all the world. But here I was, ready for one of the greatest wine moments in my life. A look, a swirl and a sip later, I was transported into another space and time and now into the 4th dimension. The wine was so amazing, and immediately became my highest rated Bordeaux barrel sample. I gave the wine 99-100 points. Now three years later, I find myself in a perfect job with a new company. I loved my old guys and they took care of me well, but in my newly created position of Chief Storyteller at Wine.com, I found myself in a spot with tasting greater opportunities including a moment in front of a finished bottled of the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. I knew I would love the wine, but there were so many famous Bordeaux in the room including Ducru-Beaucaillou, Pichon Lalande, Palmer, and others, that my senses were on overload. Many of these wines were poured. I had also tasted out of barrel in 2011. The anticipation was almost too much. The wine performed magnificently and had reached the pinnacle I had expected. Deep and dark in color as it had been out of the barrel, a miraculous aroma of black currant, steel, chalk and oak, nicely melded and talking to me like no other wine; medium bodied, yet firm, robust and elegant in stature; rich flavors, just beginning to reveal themselves, black fruit, violets, sweet oak, vanilla, mineral and all of those usual suspects, gently folding into each other; long finish, loads of sweet tannins to secure its longevity. Are there any perfect wines? Maybe not, but this is one of the very finest wine experiences ever, from a newly hatched barrel sample in Bordeaux to the finished wine in a bottle in San Francisco, the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild is of the greatest wines ever!

Grown at a 116-acre vineyard at the southern border of Pauillac, some of the vines now reaching 100 years of age on a gravel bar overlooking the Gironde, Latour harvests cabernet sauvignon with natural power. I could describe it as colors, from glistening ruby to purple-black then back to scarlet tannins that vibrate in red. Or just the pure, unadulterated flavor of black currant, unformed as a child is unformed, beautiful as a child is beautiful. However I might describe it, the wine is stronger than I am and will outlast me by decades. This is the most provocative and most brilliant Latour I have tasted on release."}, {"reviewer_name": "James Suckling", "initials": "JS", "rating_str": "100", "content": "A very complex nose of lavender, currants, spices, and hot stones. Full and dense on the palate, with a very tight structure. The tannins have a perfect polish to their density, and the finish is very intense, with wonderful fruit and truffle character.

This is a very challenging wine to get to know, please leave this for at least ten years."}, {"reviewer_name": "Wine Spectator", "initials": "WS", "rating_str": "99", "content": "Dark ruby black in color. Brilliant, intense aromas of mineral, blackberry and currant, with hints of Indian spices and cigar box, lead to a full-bodied palate, with ultrafine tannins and a beautiful balance of blackberry, raspberry and mineral.
